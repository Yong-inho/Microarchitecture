# Ideas    
Microarchitectural internal buffers introduced to optimize the performance of processors (e.g., Store buffer, Load buffer, Line fll buffer, etc...)
 currently become exploitable since side channel attacks(e.g., FLUSH+RELOAD), Meltdown, and Spectre were introduced.    

# Objective    
Find a new attack vector exploiting microarchitectural side channel    
or    
Find a new techinque that mitigates currently proposed microarchitectural side channel attacks    

# Plans
Currently I studying... (see ./Papers directory)    
<ol>
<li>Meltdown and Meltdown-like attacks to understand how currently proposed attacks work.</li>    
  <li>Intel microarchitecture to find a new exploitable point.</li>
  </ol>
